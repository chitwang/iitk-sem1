        <h2 class="h2">ABOUT THE COURSE
        </h2>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>The main motive of the course is to develop logic buliding. It is a compulsory course for all.</li><br>
            <li>The lab sessions were held through <a href="https://esc101.cse.iitk.ac.in/">Prutor</a>.</li><br>
            <li>My instructor: Dr. Swarnendu Biswas</li><br>
            <li>There were a total of 11 labs out of which best 10 were considered. Each lab had a weightage of 7%. So,
                total weightage of labs = 70%. The remaining 30% comprised of 3 quizzes (10% each).</li><br>
            <li>Below is the collection of all the practice , lab and quiz questions with their solutions. The answers
                are correct according to me (atleast the programs have passed all the test cases) , but better to verify
                yourself.</li><br>
            <li>Before seeing solutions , try the questions yourself atleast once or twice.</li><br>

        <h2 class="h2">PRACTICE QUESTIONS</h2>
        <p style="color:rgb(158, 30, 52);font-size: larger;">Practice questions were provided every Sunday for the upcoming Friday lab. These questions were from the same topics as the lab. Despite the fact that practice problems were somewhat easier than the lab problems , these were quite helpful. Most importantly , these problems provided the same coding environment (of test cases) as it was in the actual labs.<br><br><a href="practice.html" >Click here to see the practice questions</a></p><hr>

        <h2 class="h2">LAB QUESTIONS</h2>
        <p style="color:rgb(158, 30, 52);font-size: larger;">Labs consisted of 3-4 questions in 3 hours. The questions were one of their own kind but they were much difficult too. Besides thr policy on unlawful practices was severe. If caught in plagiarism , straightaway zero was awarded in that question. Also, repeated offenders were penalised 10-15% of the total score at the end. So, Beware of plag.<br><br>

        <h2 class="h2">QUIZZES</h2>
        <p style="color:rgb(158, 30, 52);font-size: larger;">The quizzes were held in 2 parts - <em>mookit</em> and <em>Prutor</em> where each part was of 75 marks. Mookit part consisted of theoritical questions related to finding output , completing the code and some true/false. And the Prutor part consisted of 2 programming problems of 35 and 40 marks.<br><br>

        Besides all the above material , I am also attaching the link of a website prepared by a Y20-Harshit Raj. It has the repository of all the lab and practice questions of Y20.
