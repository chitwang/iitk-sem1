/*Consider a city with n places (numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1)connected by a bus network. A matrix C of size n Ã— n is used to store the direct connectivity between places: C[i][j] = 1 is there is a direct bus between place i and j, 0 otherwise.


Since the buses are few, and number of places is large, most of the entries in C are 0. It is possible to save space by storing only the places that have connection in a dynamically allocated matrix (A "sparse" matrix). Here information is stored only for pairs of cities that have direct connection.


Your job is to create a 2-Dimensional dynamic array D and populate it using C. Entries in the D matrix are as follows:



D[i] = NULL, if i place does not have a direct bus to any other point.

D[i] is a dynamically allocated array of size k if i is connected directly to k places.

D[i][0], D[i][1],...,D[i][k-1] entries store these places (number) in sorted order.


INPUT:


First line contains n, number of places.

Next n lines contain n entries each where each entry is either a 0 or 1 (C matrix denoting absence or presence of direct bus).


OUTPUT:

First line prints the number of non-NULL entries in D.
Next n lines print the rows of D. Print NULL if the row is NULL. Columns are separated by single space.


NOTE:

Use dynamic array to store C (or one row of C). Free it after D matrix is populated.

0 1 0
0 0 1
1 0 0
Example1 Output:

3
